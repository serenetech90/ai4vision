# ai4vision
ai4vision is a project developed by Serene Haddad, financially seeded and guided by Peter Dunne. The project name expresses a spectrum of detection applications led by the use of deep learning and computer vision to monitor specific actions in the public crowd. Currently, the project focuses on compliance with mask wear and whether it is worn correctly or not given the covid global restrictions and procedures.

The best obtained detection accuracy was 79% so far on Accuracy metric. 
The model was trained and tested in K-Folds on Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection
